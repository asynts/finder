# finder

## Features

  - Build a database of files contained in a directory. This database is stored
    in a user specific directory, but not the directory beeing indexed.

  - Allow the user to query the database for specific file names or prefixes
    of filenames. This operation should be very quick, definitly faster than
    `find`.
